# ComfyBrowser
A comfy customizable browser with all the power of google chrome.

The idea behind this project is that Chrome can be rebuilt but in a manner that lends it self to user fiddling and hacking. 


##Building the app
First install our node dependencies
```
npm install
```
Then run the application

```
electron .
```

That's all there is to it. In future realeases the build directory may be removed from the project requiring an extra step to get your application up and running, but that feels kinda silly.
