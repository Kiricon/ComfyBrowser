A comfy customizable browser with all the power of google chrome.

The idea behind this project is that Chrome can be rebuilt but in a manner that lends it self to user fiddling and hacking. 


##Building the app
First install our node dependencies
```
npm install
```
Then run the application

```
electron .
```

That's all there is to it.


##Usage

Okay how do I use this slippery son of a gun?

Well there isn't much yet but I'll keep this up-to-date as I go.

###Hotkeys
